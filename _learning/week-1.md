The start of the 10 weeks to become at least novice in C++ for Games.

## Plan

<!---
NOTE: Fill this section in at the beginning of the week!

What do you plan to do this week? What new knowledge do you want to acquire? Do you want to follow any of the learning units for the course? Do you want to work on the assignment for the course? How much time do you estimate you will spend on these tasks?
-->

By the end of this week, I want to follow the first learning unit of this course. To accomplish this, I will actively follow the class and complete the assignments. I estimate that I will spend 8 hours on this. Following the learning unit will help me to understand the basics of the course and will help me to get started with the assignment.

## Do

<!---
NOTE: Fill this in during the week.

What were you actually able to accomplish? Was it more or less than what you planned? Was the amount of time you thought you would spend on it accurate? If not, what took longer than you thought it would?

Provide as much context as possible. Use code snippets or take screenshots of what you were able to accomplish. Please provide references to any additional sources of information that helped you.
-->

I followed the classes and started working om my journal and setted up my development enviorment for C++. I also explored the code within the example project and tried to understand the code. Besides that I started to think about the game I want to make for this course.

## Check

<!---
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What went well? What didn't go so well? What was the most important thing you learned this week?

Did you receive any feedback from the lecturer or your peers? If so, what was that feedback? Were you able to incorporate that feedback?

Did you give anyone else feedback? Who did you give feedback to? How did they respond to your feedback?

NOTE: Any source of feedback is feedback!
-->

I think I did well this week, I was on time for the classes and I started working on my journal. I also setted up my development enviorment for C++ and started to explore the example project. It went supprisingly well and I didn't enncounter any errors! I am looking forward to the next week.

## Act

<!---
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What action points can you identify from this week? What would you like to improve? What would you like to continue to strengthen?

If your planned time estimates were not accurate, what would you do to improve them?
-->

I want to continue working on my journal and start working on the assignment. I also want to start working on my game and start to think about the design of the game. I want to improve my C++ skills and I want to learn more about the language. I want to improve my time management and I want to make sure that I have enough time to work on the assignment and my game. The time estimates were accurate and I think I can keep up with the time estimates.
