Into the unknown

## Plan

<!---
NOTE: Fill this section in at the beginning of the week!

What do you plan to do this week? What new knowledge do you want to acquire? Do you want to follow any of the learning units for the course? Do you want to work on the assignment for the course? How much time do you estimate you will spend on these tasks?
-->

By the end of this week, I hope to learn more about pointers, references, functions and classes. To accompish this I will actively follow the classes and try to experiment with it! I think I will need to use 8 to 10 hours to get comfortable with these topics. I think that following the classes will help me to understand the basics of C++ and will help me to get started with the assignment.

## Do

<!---
NOTE: Fill this in during the week.

What were you actually able to accomplish? Was it more or less than what you planned? Was the amount of time you thought you would spend on it accurate? If not, what took longer than you thought it would?

Provide as much context as possible. Use code snippets or take screenshots of what you were able to accomplish. Please provide references to any additional sources of information that helped you.

This week I followed the classes and started to experiment with sprites and improve my GDD. I am going to build a 2D platformer like Mario, but the character is a ninja and has sushi and other japanese food as powerups. I had a bit of trouble to figure out how to put a single sprite from a spritesheet on the screen but eventually I managed to do it!

## Check

<!---
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What went well? What didn't go so well? What was the most important thing you learned this week?

Did you receive any feedback from the lecturer or your peers? If so, what was that feedback? Were you able to incorporate that feedback?

Did you give anyone else feedback? Who did you give feedback to? How did they respond to your feedback?

NOTE: Any source of feedback is feedback!
-->

I think I did quite well this week, I have a bit of hard time understanding pointers and references but I think it will become more clear when I get some hands-on experience with it. I also started to experiment with sprites and I think I am getting the hang of it. I am looking forward to the next week!

## Act

<!---
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What action points can you identify from this week? What would you like to improve? What would you like to continue to strengthen?

If your planned time estimates were not accurate, what would you do to improve them?
-->

I think I need to improve my understanding of pointers and references. I will start doing a few refreshing practices using these topics. I came a bit short in time this week, this is due to my internshhip and the birthday of my little sister. I will need to learn how to plan my time better and I will need to start working on my assignment earlier.
