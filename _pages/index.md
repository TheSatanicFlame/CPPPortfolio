## Introduction

Hey, I'm Niek, I'm currently studying Software Development at Graffisch Lyceum Rotterdam, I'm 20 years old. I live in Melissant on the island Goeree-Overflakkee, My dream eventually is to create surreal enviorments where people would love to get lost in.

I've got into programming because I was amazed at how people made something amazing out of nothing, I wanted to be able to do that too. I started with web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and later on I started with C# and Unity. I've been doing that for a while now, but I want to step up, so now I'm here to learn C++. So I will be able to enroll in the Creative Media and Game Technologies course at the Breda University of Applied Sciences.

I'm currently on an internship at Internetbureau Slik located in Rotterdam

## Strengths

<!---
What are your strengths? What are you good at? Are you good in math? Do you like solving difficult problems? Do you consider yourself a critical thinker? Do you like to work in teams or do you do better as a solo flyer? What will you do to nourish your strengths?
-->

I think one of my biggest strenghts is that I have the ability to understand something quickly and/or easily. I'm also a very creative person, I like to think outside the box and come up with new ideas. I'm also a very social person, I like to work in teams and I'm not afraid to ask for help when I need it.

## Weakness

<!---
What are you not so good at? What do you find difficult? What do you want to improve about yourself? How do you think you can realize those improvements?
-->

I think one of my biggest weaknesses is that I'm not very good at planning, I tend to procrastinate a lot. I also have a hard time focusing on one thing at a time, I tend to get distracted easily. I wish to improve my planning skills and my focus, I think I can do this by making a schedule and sticking to it. I also think that I can improve my focus by working in a quiet environment.

## Accomplishments

First of all, I passed the Unity Exam, only 5 out of my class did

I'm currently working on a amazing project to blend Minecraft with Anime using RPG gamemodes on a custom map, It is called AnimeMC and it is a Minecraft server. I'm the founder and lead developer.

I also crafted a beautful bootleg version of Spotify, it's called Dramidify. I used it for an exposition at my school in my second year.

## Hobbies

<!---
What do you like doing in your spare time? What is your favorite video game (right now)? What kind of movies do you like? What kind of music do you like? Where is your favorite vacation spot?
-->

To be honest, programming is my biggest hobby, I love to create things. I also like to play video games, my favorite games right now are probably Minecraft, Horizon Zero: Dawn, Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart and I've lately been getting into fortnite again. I also like to watch anime, my favorite anime is probably Food Wars. I also like to listen to music, my favorite genre is probably EDM.

## Career Goals

<!---
What do you want to do when you graduate? What role do you see yourself in? Do you want to be the graphics programmer on your team or the gameplay programmer? Or maybe you are more interested in physics programming? Or maybe you'd just rather be the all-in-one guy that can help everyone in your team? Where do you want to work? Be specific! What companies appeal to you? Do you want to work in your home country or abroad? What steps do you need to take in order to acquire this job?
-->

I would love to get a position at Guerilla Games or Riot Games, Rockstar games would be sick too! I'm more an allrounder, I love to do everything, but I think I would like to be a gameplay programmer the most. I would love to work in the Netherlands, but I'm not afraid to go abroad, If I'm going I will probably end up in Los Angeles. I think I need to get a degree in Creative Media and Game Technologies at the Breda University of Applied Sciences to get a job at one of these companies. Besides that you need to just have confidence in yourself and your skills.
